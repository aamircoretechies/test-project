  "faqPart1": "Pricing and Payments Q&A",
  "question1": "Is there a minimum order size?",
  "answer1": "Yes, the minimum order size is 30€. This is either a medium sized Wash & Fold bag or separate items in your Clean & Press garment bag. Basically your cart just has to add up to 30€ (excluding service fee) and you are ready to place your order!",
  "question2": "How much does it cost?",
  "answer2": "Our flat-rate Wash & Fold laundry pricing makes laundry predictable and affordable. We've eliminated the hassle and sticker shock of per kilo pricing. Stuff your bags full to the neck. If you can close it, we take it. With that, we have a €30 bag (Medium) & a €50 (Large) bag for wash & fold laundry",
  "answer2-P2": "Delicates and dry cleaning & launder-press garments are priced per piece between €3-€20. When you fill your Clean and Press bag, make sure you remember what you filled it with, and when placing your order, you just easily tap the items on checkout and the quantity thats in the bag.",

  "answer3": "There are some special requests that we charge extra for. These request have to be specified in your order notes.",
  "question4": "Do you offer next-day service?",
  "answer4": "Although we would always love to deliver your clothes and laundry as quick as possible, sometimes logistics don't allow. At the moment we don't have a next day service as standard, but, if you really are in a rush, email or WhatsApp us, and we can always try upon availability. It might cost some euros extra though as you understand.",
  "question5": "Do you accept walk in orders?",
  "answer5": "We do not unfortunately. All ordering is processed online for pickup and delivery service. Got questions? Feel free to contact us on WhatsApp +34 690 849 277 or email info@mrkliin.com.",
  "question6": "Can I actually save money by using Mr Kliin?",
  "answer6": "YES! Doing your laundry at home is sometimes more expensive in the long run, than using a laundry service. Adding the expenses of water, electricity and detergents, can turn out costly, specially if you are a big family.",
  "answer6-P2": "One of the biggest electricity consumers in your home is in fact the washing machine.",
  "answer6-P3": "Lets not talk about time. If there is anything that money cant buy, is time. We know how it can be, long days, work, dinner preparation, house cleaning, grocery shopping and on. And on top of that doing 5 loads of laundry on a Sunday, hang them out, let them dry, fold them. What about self time? At least one thing that you don't have to worry about with Mr Kliin, is the laundry. You just saved time!",
  "question7": "How do I pay?",
  "answer7-H1": "Credit/Debit Card Online",
  "answer7-P1": "Payments are done online through your credit/debit card. But you don't have to always use your credit/debit card to pay, every time you order a pickup you can choose way of payment, which can be cash on delivery as well.",
  "answer7-H2": "Cash",
  "answer7-P2": "When you order your pickup, you can choose preferred way of payment: cash. This means that, when your driver delivers your bags back to you, you will have to pay cash at the door.",

  "answer7-P3": "You can easily pay us with your credit/debit card at delivery. Our Mr Kliin valet has a wireless card machine. Just choose this way of payment when you place your order.",

  "question8": "I don't live here, Im just going to use you once?",
  "answer8": "Just in town as a visitor? You can still sign up and place your order, but specify in the instructions that you will only use us once. The driver will bring special one time bags for you and you can use them. Or send us a WhatsApp!",

On your pickup day a Mr Kliin Valet will arrive on your chosen day and time preference. They’ll bring Mr Kliin bags for Wash & Fold (medium and large) and a Clean & Press garment bag, which will all be tagged with your information.

  "answer20": "Yes, don't worry. At the laundry they will separate darks and light anyway. But you have to make sure that you at least have 5 or more items or one load of laundry (min 4 kilos) of any color, in the bags.
